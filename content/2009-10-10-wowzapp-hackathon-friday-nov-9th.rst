**THIS EVENT WILL BE ON A SCHOOL DAY DURING CLASS HOURS **

Microsoft will be hosting a worldwide hackathon with the release of
Windows 8!  The focus of the hackathon will be app development for
Windows 8.  With the release of Windows Surface RT and Windows 8 phone,
Microsoft wants people to get a head start with developing applications
on Windows 8.

If you're interested in this event, registration is free and they
recommend that you bring a laptop with Windows 8 and Visual Studios 2012
installed.  Not many of us have any real experience with app
development, I myself have no experience at all, but this is a good
chance to see other computer scientists come together and create
something new.  Technology is always advancing and there is always
something new around the corner, so if you're interested please come and
join us to learn something new, or if you have experience, come to share
and receive ideas from others.

This is the registration website with more in-depth information on the
event including time and place:

day, so if you plan skipping class this is a decision on your own
accord.*
